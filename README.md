# Context-Aware Geospatial Data Retrieval Using LLM/NLP

Our solution for context-aware geospatial data retrieval integrates cutting-edge Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver real-time, multimodal, and interactive geospatial data processing and visualization.

### Key Components:
- *GPT-4 and BERT Integration*: Used in conjunction with various GANs to enable dynamic map updates, seamless multimodal query processing, and precise semantic search capabilities.
- *Interactive Map Interface*: Powered by GPT-4 and GauGAN, allowing visual region selection.
- *Historical Data Retrieval & Temporal Context Awareness*: Managed by GPT-4 and TimeGAN.
- *Personalized Query Recommendations & Cross-Language Support*: Achieved using GPT-4, VAE-GAN, and mBERT.
- *Augmented Reality Integration*: Enhances user interaction with geospatial data.
- *Geospatial Data Summarization & User-Driven Data Annotation*: Key features for improved data utility.
- *Environmental Impact Analysis & Emergency Response Integration*: Facilitated by specialized GANs.
- *IoT Data Integration*: Incorporates real-time data from IoT sources.
- *Advanced Filtering & Layering Capabilities*: Allows simultaneous visualization of different data types.

This comprehensive system effectively understands and retrieves geospatial data based on user queries, meeting and exceeding the challenge's requirements.
